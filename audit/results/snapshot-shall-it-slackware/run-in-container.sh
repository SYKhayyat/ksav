# Shall v7 integration harness — runs INSIDE a disposable container as root.
#
#   Usage: run-in-container.sh <native-backend> [package]
#   e.g.   run-in-container.sh apt jq
#
# Driven entirely through the real `shall` binary against the distro's native
# package manager AND against every other package manager the image ships.
# Isolation is by env var (SHALL_CONFIG_DIR / SHALL_DATA_DIR), so Shall's own
# state is a throwaway; real system packages ARE installed and removed (that is
# the point — it is a disposable container).
#
# HARD assertions: every check either passes or fails the whole run (exit 1 at
# the end if any failed). A short, honest list of "soft" checks (genuinely
# network/ecosystem-optional) is reported but never fails the run.
#
# The run ends in a COVERAGE AUDIT (IV.1) that hard-fails on any backend or any
# subcommand nothing touched. That is the only check here that can notice what
# is *missing* from the list above it — a fixed set of checks cannot.

# Why an install failed — a question, not an assumption (E5).

# once was it the network: one was Shall correctly refusing, two were real argv defects
# (`helm`, `luarocks`). Coverage disappeared exactly where the product was broken, and the run
# still reported success.
#
# Sets CLASS to one of:
#   refused    Shall declined on purpose (exit 3, U21). Its own outcome, not a failure.
#   timeout    the build ran out of clock (124). The harness's limit, not a verdict.
#   transient  failed once, succeeded on retry. The caller CONTINUES the lifecycle — skipping
#              it is how list, PATH, remove and gone-from-list went unrun for every backend
#              whose install was flaky.
#   exhausted  Shall classed the failure passing and it did not pass in this window — a rate
#              limit with 20 minutes left on it. SOFT, and recorded as a lifecycle this run
#              could not measure, which is not the same fact as a lifecycle that got worse.
#   defect     failed permanently, or failed twice with nothing classifying it. Hard.
#
# Twinned with scripts/integration-windows.sh's, and lifted out of both by
# scripts/harness-logic-test.sh so the two cannot drift into disagreeing about a verdict.
#
# TRANSIENCE IS READ, NOT RE-DERIVED (R-3). It is a claim that a second attempt could differ,
# and Shall already answers it — `Retryability`, from the backend's own exit policy. Until
# 2026-07-30 nothing downstream could see that answer, so this function re-derived it by
# RETRYING THE INSTALL IMMEDIATELY. That proxy is wrong for exactly the failures the
# classification gets right: a GitHub rate limit with 1236 seconds left on the window cannot
# succeed one second later, so it scored `defect`, the macOS leg went red, and the
# real-lifecycle ratchet fell 8 -> 7 and went red behind it. Two red jobs over an answer the
# program had already computed.
#
# So `shall-failure-class:` is read, and the retry is kept only where it still adds evidence:
#
#   permanent  -> a defect now. Retrying a 404 to confirm it is still a 404 costs a minute and
#                 tells nobody anything.
#   transient  -> retry ONCE, because "a second attempt could differ" is worth testing where
#                 testing it is cheap. A repeat is NOT a defect: it is exhausted, which is what
#                 `Retryability::Exhausted` means — the claim was tested and did not hold, and
#                 "this can never work" is more than was measured.
#   unknown    -> retry once and treat a repeat as a defect. Nothing classified it, so here the
#                 retry IS the evidence.
#
# A missing class line is a defect too: every failing command emits one, so its absence means
# the binary under test is not the tree that was built.
# $5 runs between the two attempts, to clear a declaration the failed attempt left behind.

# 14. REAL lifecycle for every other manager this image ships
# ==========================================================================
# The `tools` image installs fifteen ecosystem managers and its header promises
# each of them a real install → list → remove. Until this section existed the
# promise was prose: `run.sh` mapped tools→apt, so the image was `ubuntu` with a
# forty-minute build and every expansion backend was proven only against mocked
# output — which is the one thing that never drifts, while drift is where every
# real bug in Part VII came from.
#
# Install failure is SOFT (a registry outage is not a Shall bug); everything
# after a successful install is HARD. That split is what caught the pixi
# `global remove` vs `global uninstall` bug a dry-run plan could never see.

#   remove-mode full        uninstall must succeed and the name must be gone
#               unsupported the manager has no uninstall verb; the contract is a
#                           refusal that SAYS so, and that is what is asserted

# The ceiling for the block below, and it may only go DOWN. Raising it is Q4's item 4 happening.
#
# **Measured, not guessed** — 12, read off the openSUSE run of 2026-07-30, the first run of this
# harness after `primary_manager_image` stopped it counting a distro's own manager as uncovered.
# The twelve: brew emerge eopkg guix lvm paru pkg pkg_add pkgin slackpkg yay zfs. Three of those
# have images being built for them; the BSDs need a userland no Linux container can host, and
# `emerge` is smoke-only by design.
# 10 on the `tools` image and 11 on every other one, and this constant is shared — so lowering
# it to 10 on the tools measurement turned the `storage` job red for a reason that had nothing
# to do with storage: `nix` is installed in `tools` and nowhere else, so only that image can
# reach 10. Measured on CI 30680916682, and put back the same hour.
#
# **The real fix is a ceiling per image**, the way `scripts/lifecycle-floor.txt` is a floor per
# host class and for exactly the same reason — one number over unlike machines is a number that
# is wrong for all but one of them. Not done tonight, and named here rather than left as a
# surprise for whoever next lowers this line.
#
# **Left at 11 deliberately on 2026-08-11.** Ten names moved out of the gap and into
# `no_lifecycle_reason` that day — the other distributions' native managers, which had been
# counted and never named — so every image's number falls, and by different amounts. Lowering
# this to a number nobody has measured is the mistake the paragraph above records happening once
# already, against `storage`. The soft branch prints each image's new count; take the largest of
# them from the next full matrix run and lower this line to it.

# ==========================================================================
# Section 14's lifecycle is install → list → remove, so it proves a volume can be *made* at a
# declared size and never that the number can be edited. Q19 ruled that it can: a bigger `@size`
# grows the volume, a smaller one is refused unless the line carries `@allow_shrink=true`.
#
# **That path cannot be proven by argv.** `lvextend --resizefs` shells out to `fsadm`, which
# talks to the filesystem, and the whole safety story — a shrink gives up bytes nothing is using,
# and a filesystem that cannot shrink stops the operation before the volume moves — lives in what
# that program does, not in the arguments it is handed. V.106's lesson from the run before this
# one: a backend that has never been executed has not been reviewed, it has been proofread.
#
# The converged re-run at the end is the assertion that matters most. D13's failure mode is a
# comparison that gets units wrong and reports a change on every sync **for ever**, and it is
# invisible to a test that syncs once.

# image could always have run this and none did — the exemption described the table rather than
# the subject, and the table is ours.
#
# The other two dependent statements are not here, and their reasons survive re-derivation:
# `service:` needs an init system a container does not run, and `setting:` writes to a settings
# store with no bus here. Both are drivable on the NATIVE sweeps, which are not containers.

# network, an init system or a privilege: a shim is a copy of the shall binary, a dotfiles tree is
# a directory walk, and an `exec:` is a script the configuration carries. Every image in this
# matrix could always have driven all three, and the only thing that ever had was a hermetic Rust
# test against a temp directory.
#

# that runs code the configuration carries, and whether a real `shall sync` on a real machine
# REFUSES an unapproved script, then runs it once approved, then declines to run it twice under
# `@runs=1`, then runs its `@undo=` when the line goes away, had never been seen outside a
# fixture. Four rules, one lifecycle, and a container is exactly where it belongs.

# Counting `InProgress` lines therefore answers "how many operations ever started", which on a
# healthy run is every one of them. The first draft of this section did exactly that and

# `InProgress`, `Failed` and `Completed` in one file.
#
# So the question is about the LAST line for each id, which is what `get_incomplete_actions`

# 16g. A SNAPSHOT, A MUTATION, AND A RESTORE — on a real device (GRADER §5)
# ==========================================================================
# `SnapshotProvider::restore` had never executed. Section 13b gives btrfs and lvm real block
# devices and section 14 installs into them, but a lifecycle is install → list → remove and by
# construction never restores anything. So the most destructive effector in the program — the
# one that puts a filesystem back — was argv-tested and unrun, which is exactly what `GRADER`
# §5 says needs a disposable machine.
#
# lvm and not btrfs, and the reason is in the shipped rows rather than in a preference: btrfs's
# built-in row is create-only (`restore_how`, no `restore` argv) because a live btrfs rollback
# replaces the root subvolume, and zfs needs an out-of-tree kernel module this container's host
# does not have. lvm is U27's exemplar USER row — thirty lines of data in `adapters/` — so
# driving it proves the plugin door as well as the effector, which is the K17/U1 rule.

# automated gate is a **release blocker**, and its item 4 is *no new backend is added until the
